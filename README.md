## Projects

Here you will find a curated selection of my projects. These include both course-related works and personal projects I’ve worked on. Each project highlights different aspects of my skills and interests in coding, problem-solving, and data science.

### 1. **Geospatial Insights: Analyzing Building Density with GeoPandas**  
   - **Description**: In this project, I explored the basics of GeoPandas by working with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for the Philippines. The task involved extracting relevant geospatial data, creating a simple visualization, and calculating the building density for a specific city or municipality. By leveraging GeoPandas, I gained hands-on experience in geospatial data manipulation and analysis, ultimately generating insights into urban structure and development patterns.

### 2. **Exploring Vacation Rental Prices: Spatial Regression Analysis in Metro Manila**  
   - **Description**: In this project, I applied spatial regression techniques to analyze vacation rental prices in Metro Manila. By evaluating factors such as location, neighborhood characteristics, and various spatial variables, I uncovered insights that can assist property owners, investors, and potential renters in understanding the pricing trends and dynamics in the region.
   - **Technologies**: Python, R, SQL, etc.

### 3. **Byaheng Late: Evaluating University Accessibility and Road Disruption using Isochrone and Centrality Analysis**  
   - **Description**: This study focuses on providing valuable insights into travel times to universities within urban cities. We analyzed and visualized both ideal travel times and the actual travel times to universities in Quezon City and Manila City following road disruptions. Using isochrone maps and centrality analysis, we illustrated the impact of these disruptions on accessibility, helping to better understand the flow of traffic and the real-time effects on travel efficiency to key destinations.
